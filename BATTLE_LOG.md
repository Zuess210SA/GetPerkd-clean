# 🏆 The Battle of the Clean Commit  
**Date of Victory:** August 15, 2025  

This is the story of how **Get Perk’d** survived weeks of chaos, bugs, and slow pushes to emerge clean, safe, and stronger than ever.

---

## ⚔️ The Enemy Forces
- **Replit** – constant quirks, mysterious errors, and deployment confusion  
- **OneDrive** – the sync demon slowing every push to a crawl  
- **Git Config** – LF/CRLF spam at every commit  
- **GitHub** – hard rejection of any file over 100MB  
- **VS Code** – popups and prompts at the worst possible moments  
- **Founder Fatigue** – 4 hours of sleep, frustration, and burnout  

---

## 📜 The Timeline
- **Weeks of prep**: Cleaning build artifacts, removing secrets, setting `.gitignore`  
- **Multiple false starts**: Endless loops of `repo not found`, `remote end hung up`, and partial pushes  
- **The CRLF Truce**: Setting `core.autocrlf` and `core.safecrlf` to stop the noise  
- **The OneDrive Problem**: Realizing push speeds were crippled by sync locking  
- **The 1% War**: Watching “Writing objects…” crawl from 0% to 100% over hours  
- **Final Push**: 1.26 GB of code uploaded in a single, nerve-wracking run  
- **Victory**: Commit landed clean on GitHub, all files intact, no secrets leaked

## 🏅 Lessons Learned
1. **Keep repos outside OneDrive** for speed & stability  
2. **Run big file checks before pushing** to avoid GitHub’s 100MB limit  
3. **Fix CRLF settings early** to prevent warning spam  
4. **Use GH CLI or pre-create repos** to avoid “not found” loops  
5. **Tag stable commits** so you always have a safe rollback point  

---

## 🎯 The Result
- Repo safely stored on GitHub  
- Tag: `v1.0-clean`  
- A battle-tested workflow for all future pushes  
- And a story worth telling for years to come

*"And they lived happily ever after… until the next feature request."*
