## üåç GEOGRAPHIC CITY CARD SYSTEM: PRODUCTION READY

### Core Functionality Validated:
- **San Antonio zone**: 30-mile radius with 14 campuses mapped
- **Austin zone**: 25-mile radius with precise coordinates
- **San Marcos zone**: 25-mile radius covering Texas State
- **Haversine calculations**: Geographic distance algorithm working perfectly
- **Fallback logic**: Address text matching operational
- **Database schema**: All tracking columns successfully implemented

### API Test Results:
```json
{
  "san-antonio": {
    "id": "san-antonio",
    "name": "San Antonio", 
    "campusCount": 14,
    "radiusMiles": 30,
    "coordinates": {"lat": 29.4241, "lng": -98.4936}
  }
}
```
