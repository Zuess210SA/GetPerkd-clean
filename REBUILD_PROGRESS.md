## ðŸš¨ REMAINING CRITICAL TASKS

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. âœ… **Complete Schema Migration**: Clean schema with snake_case naming implemented
2. âœ… **Remove Express.js Server**: Entire server/ directory eliminated  
3. âœ… **Remove Franchise System**: Territory management tables removed from schema
4. âœ… **Remove Multilingual Features**: Core schema cleaned of unauthorized features
5. **Update Workflow Configuration**: Configure Next.js development workflow
6. **Validate Core Functionality**: Test loyalty system, auth, and basic features

### Files Removed:
- âœ… `server/` directory (entire Express.js system eliminated)
- âœ… `client/` directory (old Vite frontend structure)
- âœ… Franchise territory tables from schema (clean schema created)
