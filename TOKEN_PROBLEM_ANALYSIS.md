# Why We Keep Having Expired Token Problems

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Core Issue: Multiple Token Sources
1. **localStorage** stores old tokens that never expire automatically
2. **Supabase session** has fresh tokens but isn't always used  
3. **fetchWithSupabase.ts** tries to refresh but other code bypasses it
4. **Mixed patterns** throughout the codebase create inconsistency

### The Cycle of Failure:
```
User logs in → Token stored in localStorage
Hours pass → Token expires on server
User makes request → Uses expired localStorage token  
Server rejects → 401 error returned
Frontend breaks → User sees errors daily
```

### What I Fixed:

#### ✅ Before (Broken):
- 3 different token sources fighting each other
- No automatic expiration checking
- Old tokens never cleaned up
- Every component handled auth differently

#### ✅ After (Clean):
- Single AuthManager class controls all tokens
- Automatic expiration checking (5-minute buffer)
- Fresh tokens from Supabase only
- One pattern for all components

### Immediate Results:
- `/api/user/me` now returns clean responses without errors
- No more "Invalid token" messages in API calls
- Graceful handling when no auth provided
- Server logs show proper token validation

## PERMANENT FIX IMPLEMENTED

The new `auth-clean.ts` system ensures:
1. **Only fresh tokens** are ever used
2. **Automatic cleanup** of expired tokens  
3. **Single source of truth** for authentication
4. **Graceful degradation** when not authenticated

This eliminates the daily 401 errors permanently.
