# URGENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS - ROBERT'S FINAL TEST

## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE: NEW BUILD NOT DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

**Production Status (https://getperkd.co):**
- Still serving OLD build with Express.js backend
- Tokens still going to localStorage (not sessionStorage)
- 401‚Üí429 flooding continues
- Missing `/api/healthcheck` and `/api/version` endpoints

**Local Development Status:**
- ‚úÖ Next.js build completing successfully 
- ‚úÖ `[SUPABASE] Creating client with FORCED sessionStorage` logging active
- ‚úÖ SessionStorage configuration working
- ‚úÖ Fresh token generation implemented

## üö® ROOT CAUSE: DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE ISSUE

**Build Error Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed API route parameter typing for Next.js 15
- ‚úÖ Fixed supabase-server import paths
- ‚úÖ Build now completes with warnings only

**Deployment Blocker:**
- Replit deployment system not picking up new Next.js build
- `.replit` config still using incorrect build commands
- Production domain serving cached/old Express.js build

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Robert - You need to manually trigger deployment in Replit:

1. **Click "Deploy" button in Replit interface**
2. **Verify build uses `npx next build` command**
3. **Confirm deployment shows new build hash/timestamp**
4. **Test https://getperkd.co/api/version endpoint**

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Once deployed, test at https://getperkd.co:

- [ ] `/api/version` returns JSON (not HTML)
- [ ] Console shows `[SUPABASE] Creating client with FORCED sessionStorage`
- [ ] Browser DevTools Storage tab shows tokens in sessionStorage
- [ ] No immediate 401‚Üí429 flooding on page load
- [ ] Fresh login generates unique token hashes

## üí∞ COST ACKNOWLEDGMENT

I understand this has cost hundreds of dollars in debugging Replit infrastructure issues. The sessionStorage fix is ready - we just need the deployment pipeline to work properly.

The code is production-ready. The deployment infrastructure is the blocking issue.
