✅ Competitive Edge Summary: Last-Chance Review Before Launch
🧩 What Some Competitors Still Do Well (and How We Respond):
1. Loyalty Integration
What others do: Platforms like FiveStars or Toast offer punch cards or point-based rewards directly in their ecosystem.
Why it matters: Boosts customer retention post-deal.

💡 Your Strategy:
You're already running this natively in Vibe Loyalty — your own loyalty platform.
✅ We’ll cross-promote Get Perk’d & Vibe Loyalty in September.
✅ Loyalty upgrades can be offered as a DFY upsell to merchants post-onboarding.

2. AI Deal Suggestions for Users
What others do: “Recommended for you” based on preferences, past redemptions, or peer activity.
Why it matters: Improves user engagement and redemption frequency.

💡 Your Strategy:
✅ AI recommendation engine is already half-baked and tracking user redemptions.
✅ You’ve greenlighted moving this up in the roadmap immediately post-launch.
✅ Will include friend trends + user streak behavior for gamified recs.

3. Deep POS Integration
What others do: Groupon and competitors integrate with Clover, Toast, etc. to auto-validate deals at checkout.
Why it matters: Easier redemption flow for large chains or multi-locations.

💡 Your Strategy:
✅ Already on your Q4 roadmap for enterprise & multi-location accounts.
✅ For now, self-redeem + staff PIN is the right lightweight solution.
✅ Will revisit POS APIs once franchisee + enterprise demand reaches 10+ locations.

4. Automated Review Requests
What others do: Apps like Yelp and Toast send post-visit texts/emails asking for reviews.
Why it matters: Businesses crave public feedback and social proof.

💡 Your Strategy:
✅ You're building an in-house 5-star review system (like Google’s but verified).
✅ Reviews are verified via redemption, so no fake users or bots allowed.
✅ Two levels of visibility:

Merchant Reviews on the business profile (cumulative, not hideable)

Deal-Specific Reviews shown on the offer card itself

✅ Businesses cannot opt out of showing reviews — Get Perk’d will not hide performance data.
✅ Comments are allowed (short + helpful vote sorting), but will not slow the system due to pagination and indexing.

🧠 Bonus Feature:
This builds trust, encourages merchant accountability, and signals deal quality at a glance — all while being lightweight and optimized.

🏁 Final Launch Positioning:
You're not just matching what competitors do — you’re exceeding them with:

Authentic cultural UX (multilingual slang + emoji/tone matchers)

Full transparency reviews with behavioral verification

Modular roadmap to add loyalty, AI personalization, and POS sync

Your version is leaner, smarter, and more human — built for the next generation of students, not yesterday’s coupon clippers.
