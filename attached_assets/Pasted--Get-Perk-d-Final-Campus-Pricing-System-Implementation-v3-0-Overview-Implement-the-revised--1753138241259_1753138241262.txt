🛠️ Get Perk’d – Final Campus Pricing System Implementation (v3.0)
✅ Overview
Implement the revised pricing tier system with enforced campus limits, optional add-ons, prorated billing, and smart upsell logic.

📦 Tier Breakdown
Tier	Price	Campus Access	Add-Ons Allowed
Starter	$49/month	3 campuses	✅ Yes (+$10/campus)
Growth	$99/month	6 campuses	✅ Yes (+$10/campus)
Premium	$149/month	Up to 9 campuses	❌ No add-ons
Enterprise	$299/month	All 11 campuses + San Marcos + Austin	❌ No add-ons

Add-on = $10/month per additional campus

Add-ons available only for Starter and Growth

Enterprise includes all current and future campuses automatically

⚙️ Logic Implementation
1. 🎯 Campus Selection
Starter = max 3 campuses

Growth = max 6 campuses

Premium = max 9 campuses

Enterprise = all campuses (11 San Antonio + 2 citywide)

Add-ons allow businesses on Starter/Growth to unlock additional campuses beyond base limit

Campus selection must be enforced in BusinessTargetingForm.

2. 🔁 Add-On Logic
Only enabled for Starter & Growth plans

Allow selection of any campus (no geo-restriction)

Show campuses sorted by proximity (use geo-coordinates from university database)

Add-ons billed at $10/month each

3. 💸 Mid-Month Campus Add-Ons
Use Stripe proration logic to calculate partial charges

Example: Adding a campus on day 15 = $5 this cycle, full $10 starting next cycle

Show tooltip:
“You’ll only pay for the remaining days this month. Full pricing starts next cycle.”

4. 🚀 Smart Upgrade Suggestion
Trigger an upgrade banner if a user is paying close to the next tier’s cost due to add-ons:

Examples:

Starter ($49) + 3 add-ons ($79) → Suggest Growth ($99)

Growth ($99) + 4 add-ons ($139) → Suggest Premium ($149)

UI Copy Example:
💡 “You’re currently paying $79/month. Upgrade to Growth for $99 to unlock 6 campuses — and save money!”

Trigger this logic at:

Checkout

Settings > Plan section

BusinessTargetingForm (if limits are reached)

🧪 UI Requirements
✅ Tier badges and pricing clearly displayed

✅ Gray out campuses once limit is reached

✅ Show 🔒 lock icon on unselectable campuses

✅ Add-on toggle panel (only for Starter & Growth)

✅ Real-time campus counter / tracker

✅ Tooltip on locked selections:
“Upgrade to unlock this campus or add it for $10/month.”

✅ Final Notes
Starter & Growth are flexible + upsell-focused

Premium & Enterprise = fixed-value simplicity

Enterprise should future-proof against campus expansion

All logic should be centralized for maintainability across pages
