👑 Get Perk’d Franchisee Model Evaluation
Model Summary:
Franchisee pays $299/month for city-wide exclusive territory and earns 50/50 revenue share per business signed.

✅ Why It’s Fair (and Attractive) for Franchisees
1. Territory Exclusivity for Cheap
$299/month is low-risk for full-city ownership in the digital space.

Compare this to traditional franchises that cost $10K–$50K+ upfront with 5–10% royalties.

You’re essentially giving them a full local SaaS business in a box, ready to monetize.

2. Unlimited Upside Through Revenue Share
The 50/50 revenue split means franchisees earn recurring income from each merchant.

As your pricing goes up or new upsells are added (email, flyers, managed services), their slice grows too.

Aligns perfectly with hustle: More signups = more income.

3. Built-In SaaS Infrastructure
They don’t need to build anything. The tech, dashboard, support, updates — it’s all done.

Think of it as owning a local Groupon / Honey / Rakuten, but with none of the dev work.

4. Multi-Tier Monetization
They can make money in several ways:

Merchant subscriptions

Print services or promo upsells

Running local events or QR activations

Brand ambassador management

Add-on features (AI analytics, SMS credits)

5. No Employee Burden
They don’t need to hire staff unless they scale up fast.

With your tools + backend, 1 person can run a city from a laptop.

🤝 Why It’s Also Fair to You (Founder ROI)
You retain control of brand, platform, and roadmap.

Your base revenue ($299/month x cities) is guaranteed, giving stability.

Franchisees do local onboarding + growth — you scale faster without hiring a salesforce.

You’re sharing profits, not ownership.

💡 Suggestions to Keep it Win-Win
Limit City Size per Franchise

Example: “San Antonio – North Zone” and “San Antonio – South Zone” if demand grows.

Keeps exclusivity tight and prevents stagnation.

Use Geofencing for Accuracy

Let merchants self-onboard, but auto-assign them to the correct zone by business address (use Google Maps API for zip-based zones).

Ensures franchisee always gets credit for businesses in their territory.
