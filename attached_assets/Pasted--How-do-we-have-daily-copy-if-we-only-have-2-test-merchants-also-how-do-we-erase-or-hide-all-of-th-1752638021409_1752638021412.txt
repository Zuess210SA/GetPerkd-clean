 How do we have daily copy if we only have 2 test merchants?  also how do we erase or hide all of this after we test it?  I dont want actual users getting confused once we launch

🔥 That’s a smart question, boss — and shows you're thinking like a real product founder. Let's break this down:

💡 1. “How do we handle daily digest copy with only 2 test merchants?”
✅ Short-term solution (during testing):
Keep digest messages short & templated for test flows.
Example:

“🎯 Your Daily Perks (Demo):
🍕 25% Off at Pizza Rio
🥙 Free Hummus at Dallah Med
🔍 Testing Mode Active – Not real deals”

✅ Use a "Testing Mode" tag
Add a [TEST MODE] label or watermark to all outgoing test content — push, SMS, UI badges, etc.

That way, internal testers know it's not real content and actual users won’t be confused.

🧽 2. How to clean up the test data before real launch?
Here’s a solid launch hygiene checklist to keep things pro:

🔥 A. Create a TEST_MODE toggle in your system
Set a global IS_TEST_MODE = true in Replit env variables or Supabase

When true:

Display only dummy users

Show only dummy deals

Enable fake notifications

When false:

Auto-hide or delete dummy content

Prevent test users from logging in

🧹 B. Purge the test data before launch:
Use Supabase or a script to delete:

Table	Action
users	Delete Jasmine, Carlos, Taylor
deals	Delete all test deals manually
follows	Truncate the table
saved_deals	Truncate the table
notifications	Clear any logged test push history

Or tag test content with a flag like is_demo: true and auto-filter it out on launch.

🔒 C. Disable test endpoints
Once you're live:

Remove /test-notifications route

Remove admin dashboard access (or protect w/ password)

Rotate ADMIN_API_KEY so nobody can spoof notifications

🧠 Bonus: Add a “Staging” mode
Later, you might want two environments:

Production: Real users only

Staging: For internal QA + future testing

You can copy your DB schema and push to a different Supabase instance, or use a hidden subdomain like staging.getperkd.com.

✅ Final Plan (What I Suggest)
Phase	Action
🧪 During Testing	Use [TEST MODE] labels, keep copy templated
🔐 Pre-Launch	Clean DB → remove test data, rotate keys
🚀 Go Live	Turn off test features, remove dummy flows
🧰 Optional	Create a staging clone of the app for future testing
