✅ Overview
Implement the revised pricing tier system with enforced campus limits, optional add-ons, prorated billing, and smart upsell logic.

📦 Tier Breakdown
Tier	Price	Campus Access	Add-Ons Allowed
Starter	$49/month	3 campuses	✅ Yes (+$10/campus)
Growth	$99/month	6 campuses	✅ Yes (+$10/campus)
Premium	$149/month	Up to 9 campuses (San Antonio)	❌ No add-ons
Enterprise	$299/month	All 11 campuses + San Marcos + Austin	❌ No add-ons

Add-on = $10/month per additional campus

Add-ons available only for Starter and Growth

Enterprise includes all current and future campuses automatically

⚙️ Logic Implementation
1. 🎯 Campus Selection
Starter = max 3 campuses

Growth = max 6 campuses

Premium = max 9 campuses

Enterprise = all campuses (11 in San Antonio + Texas State + UT Austin)

Add-ons allow Starter/Growth users to expand past their base limits

Implement this logic in BusinessTargetingForm and any related UI elements.

2. 🔁 Add-On Logic
Enabled only for Starter and Growth plans

No geographic restriction on campus selection

Order campus list by proximity first (from university database coordinates)

$10/month per additional campus

3. 💸 Mid-Month Campus Add-Ons
Use Stripe proration logic

Example: Adding a campus on Day 15 = $5 for remainder of cycle, $10 next month

Tooltip on add-ons:
“You’ll only pay for the remaining days this month. Full pricing starts next cycle.”

4. 🚀 Smart Upgrade Suggestions
Trigger upgrade prompt when add-on spend nears next tier price.

Examples:

Starter ($49) + 3 add-ons = $79 → suggest Growth ($99)

Growth ($99) + 4 add-ons = $139 → suggest Premium ($149)

UI Banner Example:
💡 “You’re currently paying $79/month. Upgrade to Growth for $99 and unlock 6 campuses — and save money!”

Trigger upsell prompts at:

Checkout

Business settings / billing page

Campus selector when add-on cap is approached

🧪 UI Requirements
✅ Visual tier badges

✅ Lock icon + grayed out unselectable campuses

✅ Add-on toggle interface (Starter & Growth only)

✅ Real-time campus counter

✅ Tooltips for locked campuses:
“Upgrade to unlock this campus or add it for $10/month.”

✅ Final Notes
Add-on logic must be tight to prevent over-selection

Proration and smart upgrade nudges will boost MRR

Enterprise should auto-include all current + future campuses

Centralize logic for future expansion / tier customization
