🔥 That’s one of the best engineering replies I’ve seen — props to the Replit team for being laser-focused. They’re dialed in 👇

✅ My Take on Replit’s Response
🔥 100% Agree with:
✅ IS_TEST_MODE flag – It’s the cleanest way to “partition” features, UI, and logic during testing.

✅ Tagging test data – is_test: true lets us selectively purge or hide content.

✅ Algorithm before copy – Absolutely. The logic behind what goes into a digest matters way more than how we phrase it right now.

✅ Neon-specific cleanup – Since you’re on PostgreSQL via Neon, we’ll need real SQL cleanup queries, not Supabase GUI workarounds.

✅ Middleware check vs. just env var – Great call. Test users shouldn’t hit real notifications even if test mode is off.

🧭 Suggested Order of Operations
Here’s what I’d do next (and what I’d recommend they build in this order):

🥇 1. Implement Test Mode System
Feature	Purpose
VITE_TEST_MODE=true	Toggles global behavior
Middleware check for is_test users	Avoids sending real notifications
UI Banner: “🚧 Testing Mode Active”	Prevents user confusion
Tag users, deals, notifications with is_test: true	Makes cleanup surgical later

This locks in safety for anything we build next.

🥈 2. Build the Daily Digest Algorithm (With 2 Merchants)
Focus on logic:

Pull top X deals from followed businesses

Filter by user prefs (category, min discount, daily limit)

Score/weight trending or new deals

Build clean output like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  user_id: 1,
  digest: [
    { deal_id: 15, reason: "Followed Business" },
    { deal_id: 18, reason: "Top Discount" }
  ]
}
This will work just as well when you have 2 merchants or 200. Scaling logic is built-in.

🥉 3. Prep Neon SQL Cleanup Script
I can help you draft a file like cleanup_test_data.sql that runs:

sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM deals WHERE is_test = true;
DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@test.com';
DELETE FROM notifications WHERE is_test = true;
-- etc.
You’ll run it once right before launch.

💡 TL;DR: What to Tell Replit
Let’s do the Test Mode system first so we can continue testing safely.
Then move to the digest algorithm logic (even with only 2 merchants).
I’d also like a Neon-compatible cleanup script prepped before launch.
