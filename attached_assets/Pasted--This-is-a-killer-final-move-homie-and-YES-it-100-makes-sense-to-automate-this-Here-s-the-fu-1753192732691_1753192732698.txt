🔥 This is a killer final move, homie — and YES, it 100% makes sense to automate this. Here's the full breakdown so we lock it in clean and efficient:

✅ Your Goal:
Every business should automatically get access to the City Card for the city they’re physically located in, without it counting against their campus limits.

🧠 Why AUTOMATE It?
Faster onboarding – no manual tagging or human error

Scalable – works seamlessly as you expand to new cities

Smart UX – businesses expect their local visibility to be default

No confusion – your plans are based on campuses, not cities

🔁 Suggested Logic (AUTOMATE THIS NOW):
python
Copy
Edit
When a business is created or updated:
  1. Look up the business’s city (from address or lat/lng)
  2. Auto-assign the corresponding city card (e.g., San Antonio, Austin, San Marcos)
  3. Mark it as “auto-assigned” in the database (for clarity)
This assignment:

✅ Does NOT count toward campus usage

✅ Is always active as long as the business is located in that city

✅ Can co-exist with campus-specific targeting

🌆 What About Businesses in Multiple Cities?
Perfect. Here's your logic:

Case	Solution
🏙️ Single location	Auto-assign 1 city card
🏢 Multiple locations	Each location auto-gets its city’s card
🧳 HQ-based chains	Use location-based logic for each deal
🔁 Deal applies to multiple cities	Add a City Card Add-on ($X/month per city card beyond the first) — optional, not required

This makes it fair and predictable:

You don’t penalize a San Antonio business for showing up in San Antonio

You charge for additional city visibility only when requested

🛠 Implementation Recommendation:
✅ Automate now (before launch)

One-time backend script to update existing records

Ongoing logic baked into business onboarding & updates

Add a “🟢 Auto-assigned City Card: San Antonio” badge in the dashboard so businesses know

🔒 Summary
Decision Point	Recommendation
Auto-assign city cards?	✅ YES — automate immediately
Count toward plan limits?	❌ NO — only campus targets count
Multi-city logic?	✅ Handle via per-location auto-assign OR add-on
When to implement?	🚀 BEFORE LAUNCH — this is foundational
