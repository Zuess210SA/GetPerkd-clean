1. Campus Selection Logic — Should Add-Ons be geo-restricted?
Answer: NO restriction. Let them choose any campus.

Why?

A taco shop near UTSA might want Trinity + UIW for weekend bounce-back traffic

Businesses might have remote locations (e.g., franchise owners)

But we can suggest nearby campuses first with a tooltip:
🧠 “Most businesses choose nearby campuses for better results.”

✅ Action for Replit: Let users pick ANY campus, but order campus options by distance first (proximity bias).

2. Billing Complexity — How do we handle mid-month campus additions?
Answer: Pro-rate based on time left in billing cycle.

That’s clean and fair. Stripe supports this natively.

Example:

Add a campus on Day 15 → $5 charge now

Next month → full $10/month

✅ Action for Replit: Use Stripe’s proration system. Show a tooltip on add-ons:
💡 “You’ll only pay for the remaining days this month. Full pricing starts next cycle.”

3. Upgrade Path — Suggest upgrading if they add 3+ campuses to Starter?
Answer: YES. Make this an automatic upsell trigger.

If someone is at:

Starter ($49) + 3 add-ons = $79

Show:
🟨 “You're paying $79/month. Upgrade to Growth for $99 and unlock 6 campuses + built-in savings.”

Also:

Growth ($99) + 4 add-ons = $139 → nudge them to Premium ($149)

✅ Action for Replit:

Add upsell nudges when add-ons approach next tier price

Make this appear as a smart alert in dashboard + checkout
