Audit Request to Replit
Hey Replit ‚Äî can you do a quick self-audit of your Week 1 migration work to confirm that:

No parts of the schema were rewritten or renamed to fit your preferred patterns (like userId instead of user_id)

No architectural components were added that deviate from my original ZIP files (middleware layers, auth systems, folder structure, etc.)

The utils/supabase-server.ts follows my intended auth logic exactly, without extra abstractions

No business logic was changed, assumed, or ‚Äúimproved‚Äù in the base scaffolding

I trust your work ‚Äî but since this is my company, my code, my money, I want to triple-check that the foundation reflects my original architecture 100%.

Appreciate you keeping this aligned. Let me know what you find!

Let me know if you want this stored as a reusable QA instruction for future devs too.

Want me to write a checklist format version they can literally copy-paste and confirm point by point?

Perfect. Here's a clean, checklist-style QA audit prompt you can give to Replit to review the Week 1 rebuild and ensure nothing was rewritten, renamed, or re-architected behind the scenes:

üîç Week 1 Architecture Integrity Audit ‚Äì QA Checklist
Hey Replit ‚Äî before we move any further, please review your Week 1 migration work using the checklist below to ensure it strictly followed my original specs from the ZIP files:

‚úÖ SCHEMA INTEGRITY
 Confirm no schema fields were renamed (e.g., user_id was not changed to userId, created_at was not renamed to timestamp, etc.)

 Confirm no schema tables were restructured, dropped, or replaced with new abstractions

 Confirm no extra fields were added to tables that weren‚Äôt in my provided schema (e.g., business_id, campus_id, etc. were not inserted unless approved)

‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION SETUP
 Confirm the utils/supabase-server.ts file mirrors the auth logic from my ZIP, not your internal pattern

 Confirm there are no extra middleware/auth wrappers added that conflict with Supabase JWT/session management

‚úÖ FOLDER STRUCTURE & ROUTING
 Confirm Next.js 14 App Router is implemented as-is with no Express.js remnants

 Confirm no custom routing/middleware chains were added without my approval

‚úÖ ORIGINAL LOGIC PRESERVATION
 Confirm all core logic from my ZIP files (Phase 2‚Äì3 APIs) is untouched, including:

6-hour cooldown timers

Reward unlock logic

Analytics filters and views

Response formats

‚úÖ ENVIRONMENT & TOOLING
 Confirm shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and TypeScript are set up without altering my component structure or UI architecture

 Confirm no 3rd party packages were added unless explicitly approved

Please go through this checklist and confirm that everything from Week 1 is 100% aligned with my original vision. I appreciate your hard work and attention to detail ‚Äî just want to make sure the foundation reflects my architecture, not a re-interpretation.

Let me know when the review is complete and if anything needs to be rolled back or adjusted. Thanks for sticking to the playbook. üôè
