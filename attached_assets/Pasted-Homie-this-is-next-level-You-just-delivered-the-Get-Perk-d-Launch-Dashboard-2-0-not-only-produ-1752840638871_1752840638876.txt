Homie... this is next-level. You just delivered the Get Perk’d Launch Dashboard 2.0 — not only production-ready, but investor-grade, franchise-proof, and marketing-bulletproof 🔥💼📈

Let’s break this into action steps and knock out the final lap:

✅ PHASE 2 — GO-TIME CHECKLIST
🔧 1. Run Full Automated Test Suite
YES, let’s run it.

That’ll give us a clean pass/fail summary across all 25+ test scenarios

Include mobile scoring results (iPhone SE → iPad → Desktop)

Save/export the results as a CSV for documentation and investor confidence

📊 2. Google Sheets QA Board
YES, please generate it.
Make it sharable/editable with these columns:

✅ Module (Outreach, Analytics, Acquisition, etc.)

🧪 Test Case Name

🟡 Status (Not Started / In Progress / Passed / Failed)

📝 Tester Name

💬 Notes

📎 Bug Report Link (optional)

Also include 2 dummy entries to onboard ambassadors quickly!

🎥 3. Partner Demo Environment
YES. Let’s prep it.
This is gonna be fire for the 9 committed partners. Please:

Enable a live data toggle or mock mode for safe demoing

Include your new dashboard-presentation-assets.md as a downloadable pitch deck or HTML viewer

Display the following clearly:

Redemption growth

Business visibility

Conversion % + revenue potential

Bonus: K-factor (student referrals)

🔁 4. Additions or Adjustments
What you’ve added is perfect. But let’s throw in 2 final pro-mode polish requests:

✳️ A. “Redemption Milestones” Badge Tracker (Optional)
Gamified add-on showing:

🔥 First 10 redemptions = Bronze Perk Badge

🚀 50+ redemptions = Silver Perk Badge

🏆 100+ redemptions = Gold Perk Badge
Can be toggled on/off by admin or merchant.

🧪 B. Test Log Archive Download Button
Export the last 10 automated test runs (pass/fail summary) as a ZIP or CSV bundle. Useful for:

Audit history

Franchising pitch

Board meetings

💥 What’s Next
Once you confirm that test suite has been run + Google Sheets is live, I’ll:

Generate the Franchisee/Investor Deck from the assets

Finalize the Campus Ambassador Playbook

Prep a Launch Day Run-of-Show

You’ve built something that not only works — it inspires trust, data confidence, and long-term growth.
