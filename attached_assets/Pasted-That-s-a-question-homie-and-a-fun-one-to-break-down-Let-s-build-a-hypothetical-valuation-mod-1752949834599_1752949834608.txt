That's a 🔥 question, homie — and a fun one to break down.

Let’s build a hypothetical valuation model based on:

📈 Global user adoption (15% of students)

💵 Revenue per user or per merchant

📊 Investor benchmarks for similar companies

💰 Valuation multiple (based on revenue or user growth)

🌍 STEP 1: Estimate Total Addressable Market (TAM)
Let’s start with the number of college students worldwide in the regions you mentioned:

Region	Estimated Students	15% Adoption	Source
🇺🇸 USA	~20 million	3 million	National Center for Ed Stats
🇲🇽🇧🇷 Latin America	~30 million	4.5 million	UNESCO
🇪🇺 Europe	~40 million	6 million	Eurostat
🇦🇺 Australia	~1.5 million	225K	Gov data

🧮 Total 15% users globally = ~13.7 million students

💵 STEP 2: Estimate Annual Revenue
Let’s use two main revenue sources:

Merchant subscriptions (e.g., $60/month average)

Brand partnerships / ad revenue (~$0.50–$1 per user/month)

Option A: Conservative Subscription Model Only
Assume:

Each 500 users = 1 active business

13.7M users = 27,400 active merchants

Each merchant pays $60/month = $1.64M/month

→ $19.7M annual merchant revenue

Option B: Ads + Partnerships Layer
13.7M users × $0.75/month in brand revenue = $10.3M/year

💰 Total conservative revenue:
👉 $19.7M (merchant) + $10.3M (brand) = $30M/year

🧠 STEP 3: Apply Valuation Multiples
Typical multiples for fast-growing SaaS + consumer platforms:

Stage	Multiple	Valuation
Conservative (6×)	6× revenue	$180M valuation
Growth-Stage (10×)	10× revenue	$300M valuation
Aggressive (15–20×)	15–20× revenue	$450M–$600M

🧨 BUT WAIT — if investors start viewing Get Perk’d as the "Duolingo of campus commerce" (global, gamified, social), it could command a premium based on user base and data.

Wildcard: Valuation by User Base
If valued at $50/user (common for freemium platforms at scale):

13.7M users × $50 = $685M valuation

🏁 Final Summary: Hypothetical Global Valuation (15% Adoption)
Model	Revenue	Valuation
🧮 SaaS Only	$19.7M	$120M–$200M
💵 SaaS + Ads	$30M	$180M–$600M
👥 User-Based	–	~$685M

💎 TL;DR
If you hit 15% of major university students worldwide, Get Perk’d could realistically hit a $300M–$700M valuation depending on growth, margins, and investor sentiment.

And bro — that’s not even including:

Franchising/licensing fees

B2B data products

Campus card integrations

National brand sponsorships (e.g., Red Bull, Nike, etc.)
