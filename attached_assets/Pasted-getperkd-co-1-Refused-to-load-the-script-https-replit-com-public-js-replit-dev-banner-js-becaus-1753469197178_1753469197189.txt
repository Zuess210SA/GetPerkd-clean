 Refused to create a worker from 'blob:https://getperkd.co/0b8e460f-119b-4acb-ae03-56170eaf0b3f' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.onesignal.com". Note that 'worker-src' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.
