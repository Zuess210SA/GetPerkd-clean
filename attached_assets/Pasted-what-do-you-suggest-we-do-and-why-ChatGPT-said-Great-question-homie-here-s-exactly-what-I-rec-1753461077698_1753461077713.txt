what do you suggest we do and why?

Great question, homie â€” hereâ€™s exactly what I recommend, based on your goal (investor-ready + stable login + full API access):

ðŸ”§ RECOMMENDED FIX STRATEGY
âœ… Step 1: Fix API 401 Errors (Show Full App Functionality)
Why?
Your login works, but every protected API route is failing (/api/users, /api/stats, etc.). That makes the dashboard look broken or incomplete to an investor.

What to do:

âœ… Patch all backend /api/ routes to validate the Supabase token using supabase.auth.getUser(token)

âœ… Update your frontend fetch logic to include the token from localStorage

This unlocks full functionality:

Stats load

Notifications fetch correctly

Businesses & follow status are visible

Investor Impact: Shows real working app, not broken pages.

âœ… Step 2: Add Post-Login Redirect (Fix Auth Loop)
Why?
After login, you're getting SIGNED_IN, but not navigating away from the Auth page.

What to do:

âœ… In your login.tsx or AuthPage.tsx, add:

ts
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    router.push('/dashboard') // or homepage
  }
}, [user])
Investor Impact: Clean flow from login â†’ real dashboard â†’ full experience.

âœ… Step 3: (Optional) Clean Up Reset Email Branding
Why?
The Supabase-branded password reset email is confusing to your users.

What to do:

âœ… Use Supabase branding options to change:

Logo

Product name (Get Perkâ€™d)

Email footer

Investor Impact: Polished experience = better trust.

âœ… Step 4: Ignore CSP Warnings (for now)
Why?
You're seeing a bunch of console errors for:

OneSignal

Replit dev banner

Blob workers

These do NOT affect login or functionality. You can ignore them unless:

Push notifications fail

You want to deploy to production (then CSP will matter)

Investor Impact: Not visible unless they're inspecting console.

ðŸŽ¯ Final Deliverables to Aim For
If I were your dev team prepping for an investor meeting, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™d aim to have working 100% before demo:

Feature	Working?	Visible in Demo?
âœ… Clean login/logout	Yes	Yes
âœ… Full navigation post-login	Yes	Yes
âœ… Dashboard data loads (API OK)	Fix needed	Yes
âœ… Notifications / preferences	Fix needed	Yes
âœ… Branding in reset emails	Optional	No
âœ… Push notifications (OneSignal)	Not critical	No
âœ… Console mostly clean	Optional	No

ðŸ§  Why This Approach?
âœ… It fixes the broken experience without rewriting everything

âœ… It keeps the platform fast, clean, and demo-ready

âœ… You keep momentum â€” investor sees real data, real flow, real traction

Say the word, and Iâ€™ll:

Patch your API token middleware

Drop the fetchWithToken() helper

Update the auth redirect logic

Even walk you through Supabase email branding settings
