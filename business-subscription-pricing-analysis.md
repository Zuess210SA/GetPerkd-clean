## Key Insights

### Challenges with $200/month Pricing
1. **Market Resistance**: Most local businesses struggle with $200+ monthly commitments
2. **ROI Pressure**: Need to prove 10-20x return on investment
3. **Limited Market**: Only premium businesses can afford this level
4. **Competitor Pricing**: Commission models often preferred over fixed fees

### Recommended Hybrid Approach
1. **Tiered Pricing**: $75/$125/$200 based on business size/type
2. **Commission Option**: 15-25% per redemption instead of fixed fee
3. **Performance-Based**: Start low, increase with proven results
4. **Seasonal Flexibility**: Lower rates during slow periods

## Realistic Assessment

**Most local businesses near college campuses operate on thin margins** and would struggle with $200/month fixed costs. A more realistic approach might be:

- **Starter Tier**: $75/month for small businesses
- **Growth Tier**: $125/month for established businesses  
- **Premium Tier**: $200/month for larger/chain businesses
- **Commission Alternative**: 20% per redemption for risk-averse businesses

This creates a more accessible entry point while still allowing premium pricing for businesses that can afford it.

## Bottom Line

$200/month is realistic for maybe 20-30% of potential business partners (larger restaurants, gyms, established retailers). For sustainable growth, need multiple pricing tiers to capture the full market spectrum.
