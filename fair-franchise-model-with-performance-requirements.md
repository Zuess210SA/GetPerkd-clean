## Fair Economic Analysis

### Option A Economics (0% fixed fee, 25% commission)
**If businesses pay $69/month:**
- Corporate: $51.75 per business
- Franchisee: $17.25 per business
- **Break-even**: 0 businesses (no fixed cost)
- **Decent income**: 15+ businesses = $258/month
- **Good income**: 30+ businesses = $517/month

### Option B Economics ($99/month, 35% commission)
**If businesses pay $69/month:**
- Corporate: $44.85 per business
- Franchisee: $24.15 per business
- **Break-even**: 5 businesses = $120 (vs $99 fee)
- **Decent income**: 15+ businesses = $263/month profit
- **Good income**: 30+ businesses = $625/month profit

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Existing Franchisees (Grandfathering)
- Offer choice: Keep current terms OR switch to new model
- 30-day decision period
- Honor existing agreements if they prefer current terms

### Phase 2: New Franchisee Recruitment
- Market new performance-based model
- Emphasize lower risk, performance rewards
- Clear performance expectations from day one

### Phase 3: Performance Tracking Integration
- Build dashboard showing franchisee progress toward metrics
- Automated alerts for performance issues
- Monthly performance reports

## Benefits of This Model

### For Franchisees
- **Lower/No Financial Risk**: No/minimal fixed costs
- **Performance Rewards**: Better performers earn more
- **Clear Expectations**: Know exactly what's required
- **Growth Opportunity**: Can scale income with performance

### For Corporate
- **Quality Control**: Only keeps productive franchisees
- **Revenue Protection**: Underperformers can't squat on territories
- **Scalability**: Focus resources on high-performers
- **Market Coverage**: Territories stay active or get reassigned

## Recommended Implementation

**Start with Option A (0% fixed fee, 25% commission)** because:
1. Eliminates franchisee financial risk
2. Attracts more qualified candidates
3. Performance requirements ensure territory productivity
4. Corporate still keeps 75% of revenue
5. Easier to recruit during economic uncertainty

**Performance requirements ensure:**
- No territory squatting
- Consistent business development
- Active territory management
- Revenue growth for both parties

This model shifts from "pay to play" to "perform to earn" - much fairer for franchisees while protecting corporate interests through performance standards.
