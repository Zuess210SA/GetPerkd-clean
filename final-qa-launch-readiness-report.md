- **ETA:** 30 minutes

#### 2. Student Test Validation Issues (P1 - High)
- **Issue:** Student dashboard and gamification tests failing despite good performance
- **Impact:** False negative test results (features work, tests need fixing)  
- **Fix Required:** Update test validation logic
- **ETA:** 1-2 hours

#### 3. Franchisee Implementation Gaps (P1 - High)
- **Issue:** Territory management and merchant oversight missing implementation
- **Impact:** Franchisee role not fully functional
- **Fix Required:** Complete franchisee feature implementation
- **ETA:** Post-launch development (not blocking)
