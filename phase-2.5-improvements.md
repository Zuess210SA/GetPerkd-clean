## 🎯 ChatGPT's Feedback Implementation

✅ **User education**: Tips about following businesses for better curation
✅ **Fallback messaging**: Professional "no deals" experience

1. **"Show More Deals You Might Like" Button** - Exactly as requested
2. **Quality Threshold Maintained** - 40+ points for main digest
3. **Transparency Badges** - Visual indicators for why deals scored low
4. **Educational Content** - Helps users understand the system
5. **Professional Fallback** - Great UX even with no additional deals
