---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Critical Issues (P0) - Must Fix Before Launch
1. **Database Schema Error:** Missing "total_xp" column causing admin security monitoring failures
2. **Student Dashboard Test Logic:** Test failing despite good performance (408ms)
3. **Student Gamification Validation:** Feature working but test validation failing

### High Priority Issues (P1) - Should Fix Before Launch  
1. **Franchisee Territory Management:** Test simulation failures indicate missing implementation
2. **Franchisee Merchant Oversight:** Bulk operations need proper implementation

### Medium Priority Issues (P2) - Can Address Post-Launch
1. **Performance Optimization:** Average 207ms response time could be improved toward sub-100ms target
2. **Test Coverage:** Some tests are simulated rather than fully implemented
