# Replit SSL Certificate - Automatic & Free

## ✅ SSL Certificate Included:
**Replit automatically provides free SSL certificates for all custom domains** - you don't need to purchase one from GoDaddy.

## How Replit SSL Works:

### Automatic SSL Certificate:
- **Free**: No cost for SSL certificates
- **Let's Encrypt**: Uses industry-standard certificates
- **Auto-renewal**: Certificates renew automatically
- **HTTPS enforced**: All traffic automatically redirected to HTTPS

### What Happens After Domain Verification:
1. **Domain verifies** with your DNS records
2. **SSL certificate automatically provisioned** (takes 2-15 minutes)
3. **HTTPS immediately available** at https://getperkd.co
4. **HTTP redirects** to HTTPS automatically

### SSL Certificate Status:
Once your domain verification completes:
- ✅ **https://getperkd.co** - Secure with Replit's SSL
- ✅ **https://www.getperkd.co** - Secure with SSL
- ✅ **Campus subdomains** - All get SSL automatically

## Current Status:
From your screenshot, I can see `getperkd.co` in the browser address bar. Once the DNS verification completes (should be soon with your 600-second TTL), Replit will:

1. ✅ Verify your domain
2. ✅ Generate free SSL certificate 
3. ✅ Enable HTTPS automatically
4. ✅ Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

## Action Needed:
**None** - Just wait for DNS verification to complete. The SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned once verification succeeds.

## Timeline:
- **DNS verification**: Within 15-20 minutes (with your corrected records)
- **SSL provisioning**: 2-15 minutes after verification
- **Total**: Your site will be fully secure within 30 minutes

**Bottom line**: Save your money - Replit's free SSL is enterprise-grade and automatically managed.
