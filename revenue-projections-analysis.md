# Get Perk'd Revenue Projections: Reality Check Analysis
*Created: July 19, 2025*

## ðŸš¨ Original Projections (Need Review)

**Year 1: $662K ARR** 
**Year 2: $2.5M ARR**
**Year 3: $8M ARR**

These numbers were overly optimistic. Let me provide a realistic breakdown based on actual market data and comparable platforms.

## ðŸ“Š Realistic Market Analysis

### Comparable Platform Benchmarks
- **Honey**: 17M users, ~$200M revenue (2020) = $11.76 per user annually
- **Rakuten**: 15M active users, ~$1.2B revenue = $80 per user annually 
- **Groupon**: 48M customers, ~$1.8B revenue = $37.50 per user annually
- **Campus-specific apps**: Typically $2-8 per student per year

### Texas University Market Reality
- **Total addressable students**: 168K across 4 campuses
- **Realistic active penetration**: 10-15% = 17K-25K active users
- **Merchant density**: San Antonio has ~2,000 restaurants, ~500 retail businesses suitable for student discounts

## ðŸ’° Revised Revenue Model (Conservative)

### Year 1: $125K ARR (Realistic)
```
Merchant Subscriptions:
- Month 1-3: 15 merchants Ã— $49 DIY = $2,205/month
- Month 4-6: 35 merchants Ã— avg $55 = $5,775/month  
- Month 7-9: 65 merchants Ã— avg $58 = $11,310/month
- Month 10-12: 85 merchants Ã— avg $60 = $15,300/month

Total Year 1: ~$125K ARR
```

**Key Assumptions:**
- Start with 15 merchants (currently have 10 test merchants)
- 15% monthly growth rate (aggressive but achievable)
- Average revenue per merchant grows from $49 to $60 as more choose DFY plans
- No franchisee revenue in Year 1 (focus on proving model)

### Year 2: $380K ARR (Growth Phase)
```
Merchant Subscriptions:
- 200 total merchants by end of Year 2
- Average $65/month per merchant (mix of DIY $49, DFY $69, Premium $99)
- Monthly recurring revenue: $13K/month = $156K annually

Franchisee Revenue:
- 2 franchisee territories sold (Houston, Dallas)
- $15K initial fee each = $30K one-time
- 5% royalty on their merchant revenue (~$8K/month combined)
- Annual franchisee contribution: $126K

Total Year 2: ~$380K ARR
```

### Year 3: $950K ARR (Scale Phase)
```
Merchant Network:
- 500 merchants across Texas (10 cities)
- Average $70/month per merchant
- Monthly merchant revenue: $35K = $420K annually

Franchisee Network:
- 8 territories operational
- $120K in initial fees
- $40K monthly in royalties = $480K annually
- Territory support fees: $50K annually

Total Year 3: ~$950K ARR
```

## ðŸ“ˆ What Drives These Numbers?

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Merchant Retention**: Need 85%+ annual retention rate
2. **Student Engagement**: Minimum 25% monthly active users
3. **Deal Velocity**: Each merchant needs 10+ redemptions/month to see value
4. **Geographic Expansion**: Must prove model works beyond UTSA

### Revenue Per User Benchmarks
```
Student Value:
- Direct revenue: $0 (free for students)
- Indirect value: $15-25 annually (what merchants pay for access)

Merchant Value:
- Small business: $49-69/month ($588-828 annually)
- Expected ROI: 3-5x (merchant needs $150-400 monthly additional revenue)

Franchisee Value:
- Territory license: $15K initial (revised down from $25K)
- Ongoing royalty: 5% of territory revenue (revised down from 8%)
- Break-even: Need 50+ merchants per territory
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Realistic Milestones

### 6-Month Targets (More Achievable)
- 1,500 active students across UTSA
- 25 paying merchants
- $3,500 monthly recurring revenue
- Break-even on operational costs

### 12-Month Targets  
- 5,000 active students across 4 campuses
- 85 paying merchants
- $12,000 monthly recurring revenue
- First franchisee territory interest

### 24-Month Targets
- 15,000 active students
- 200 paying merchants  
- 2 franchisee territories operational
- $32,000 monthly recurring revenue

## ðŸš© Risk Factors & Reality Checks

### Major Challenges
1. **Merchant Churn**: Small businesses fail frequently (20% annually)
2. **Student Engagement**: Competing with TikTok, Instagram for attention
3. **Seasonal Variations**: Summer months see 60% drop in campus activity
4. **Competition**: Established players can copy successful features quickly

### Why Original Projections Were Too High
- **Franchisee assumptions**: $25K territory fees unrealistic for unproven market
- **Scale timeline**: National expansion takes 3-5 years, not 1-2 years
- **Revenue per merchant**: $200+/month only works for larger businesses
- **Market penetration**: 50% student adoption is extremely optimistic

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations for Investors

### Conservative Investment Thesis
- **Target Market**: Prove model in Texas first (realistic $1M ARR by Year 3)
- **Funding Need**: $500K-750K (not $2.5M) for 24-month runway
- **Use of Funds**: 60% marketing/growth, 30% engineering, 10% operations
- **Exit Strategy**: Regional acquisition by larger player in 3-4 years

### Success Metrics That Matter
1. **Monthly Active Students**: 15% of campus enrollment
2. **Merchant Lifetime Value**: $2,000+ (35+ months average)
3. **Deal Redemption Rate**: 25%+ of saved deals get redeemed  
4. **Campus Ambassador Conversion**: 1 ambassador per 200 students

### Honest Growth Timeline
- **Year 1**: Prove product-market fit in San Antonio
- **Year 2**: Expand to 3 Texas cities, validate franchisee model
- **Year 3**: Scale to 10 Texas markets, $1M ARR
- **Year 4-5**: Consider out-of-state expansion

This revised analysis provides a much more realistic foundation for business planning and investor discussions. The original projections assumed hockey-stick growth that rarely occurs in local marketplace businesses.
