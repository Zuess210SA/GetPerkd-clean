# Get Perk'd Security Audit & Hardening Plan

## Current Security Status

### âœ… Implemented Security Measures
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Supabase JWT token authentication
   - Bearer token middleware for API routes
   - Session-based user identification
   - Role-based access (students, business owners, staff)

2. **API Security**
   - Admin API key authentication for sensitive endpoints
   - Rate limiting (5 requests/minute per IP)
   - Request validation using Zod schemas
   - CORS configuration

3. **Data Protection**
   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - Database connection string security
   - OneSignal, SendGrid, Twilio API key protection

### ðŸ”§ Security Hardening Needed

#### 1. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement user-based rate limiting (not just IP)
- [ ] Different rate limits for different endpoint types
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for repeated violations
- [ ] Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints

#### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] Enhance Zod schema validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Add SQL injection prevention (already using Drizzle ORM)
- [ ] XSS prevention for user-generated content
- [ ] File upload validation (if needed)

#### 3. Session Security
- [ ] Implement session timeout
- [ ] Add session invalidation on suspicious activity
- [ ] Enhance JWT token validation
- [ ] Add refresh token rotation

#### 4. API Endpoint Security
- [ ] Audit all endpoints for proper authentication
- [ ] Add request logging for security monitoring
- [ ] Implement API endpoint versioning
- [ ] Add request size limits

#### 5. Database Security
- [ ] Implement database query logging
- [ ] Add database connection encryption
- [ ] Implement row-level security where appropriate
- [ ] Add database backup encryption

#### 6. Production Environment Security
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate setup
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Security headers implementation

## Security Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Launch Critical)
1. Enhanced authentication validation
2. Rate limiting improvements
3. Input validation strengthening
4. Session security hardening

### Medium Priority (Post-Launch)
1. Request logging and monitoring
2. Database security enhancements
3. API versioning
4. Advanced threat detection

### Low Priority (Future Iterations)
1. Security audit automation
2. Penetration testing
3. Compliance certifications
4. Advanced monitoring dashboards

## Security Testing Checklist

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Test JWT token validation
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Test role-based access control

### API Security Testing
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Test input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Test admin API key protection
- [ ] Test CORS configuration

### Data Protection Testing
- [ ] Test environment variable access
- [ ] Test database connection security
- [ ] Test API key protection
- [ ] Test user data privacy

## Security Monitoring Plan

### Real-time Monitoring
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Rate limit violations
- [ ] Unusual API usage patterns
- [ ] Database query anomalies

### Daily Security Reports
- [ ] Authentication success/failure rates
- [ ] API usage statistics
- [ ] Rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Security incident summary

### Weekly Security Reviews
- [ ] Security log analysis
- [ ] Vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Security metric trends
- [ ] Incident response evaluation

## Next Steps: Implementation Plan

1. **Week 1 (July 17-21)**: High priority security hardening
2. **Week 2 (July 22-25)**: Security testing and validation
3. **Launch Week (July 26-31)**: Final security verification and monitoring setup
